# Discordgo example :robot:

Within this folder is an example of a Discordgo ping bot. You can run the bot yourself by cloning this repository, replacing the `your-super-secret-token` in `main.go` with your bot's token, opening a command prompt in this folder, and running `go run main.go`.

You can find documentation for Discordgo [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo).
