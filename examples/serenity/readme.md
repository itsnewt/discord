# serenity example :robot:

Within this folder is an example of a serenity ping bot. You can run the bot yourself by cloning this repository, replacing the `your-super-secret-token` in `main.go` with your bot's token, opening a command prompt in this folder, and running `cargo run`.

You can find documentation for serenity [here](https://docs.rs/serenity/0.7.0/serenity/).
